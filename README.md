# e-commerce-database-functionality

## Description
This app was created to be able to test routing and request actions using sequilize. I have set the app up where you are able to GET data from categories, POST data to categories, PUT and update data, and finally DELETE data. All of this is done using different types of HTTP requests. There is four different categories that are used and are linked together using keys. In the demo video I used insomnia to demonstrate the different functionalities of the app.
